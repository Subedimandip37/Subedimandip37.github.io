I am a [Post-Graduation Research Fellow](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/undergraduate/undergraduate-research/tamayyuz-research-fellowship.html) in the Economics Department at NYU Abu Dhabi under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/raul-santaeulalia-llopis.html). My primary research interest is in labor economics, macro development, and policy evaluation.

My current research focuses on the impact of India's 1991 industrial delicensing policy. I am using structural models and firm-level data to analyze whether the reform improved efficiency by reducing entry barriers or simply increased firm heterogeneity and experimentation.

I am a May 2025 graduate of NYU Abu Dhabi and aim to pursue a PhD in economics.
